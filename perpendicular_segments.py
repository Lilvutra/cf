# coordinate points int A,B,C,D
# Inputs: int X, Y, K and t - the number of test cases  
# Outputs: Contains two lines
        # -  4 integers 𝐴𝑥, 𝐴𝑦, 𝐵𝑥, and 𝐵𝑦 — the coordinates of the first segment.
        # -  4 integers C𝑥, C𝑦, D𝑥, and D𝑦 — the coordinates of the second segment.
# 0 ≤ 𝐴𝑥,𝐵𝑥,𝐶𝑥,𝐷𝑥 ≤ 𝑋 and 0 ≤ 𝐴𝑦,𝐵𝑦,𝐶𝑦,𝐷𝑦 ≤ 𝑌 
# length of segment AB is at least K
# length of segment CD is at least K
# segments AB and CD are perpendicular
# Note that it's not necessary for segments to intersect. Segments are perpendicular as long as the lines they induce are perpendicular.
